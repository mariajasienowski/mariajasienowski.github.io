      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a native from Venezuela and I’ve been an educator in New York City Public Schools for 13 years. I teach all levels of Spanish language including AP Language and Literature. I have a bachelor's degree in Spanish Literature from Queens College, a Masters Degree in Adolescent Education from Mercy College and I am currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Spanish Language and Culture at Salamanca University in Spain. </p>
      <p>
        Living in New York City for the past 27 years  helped me understand the importance and the challenges of learning a new language. I use this experience to better understand my students’ need and provide them with different strategies that will help them acquire the Spanish language more efficiently.
